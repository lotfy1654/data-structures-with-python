# Data Structures in Python

This repository contains educational lessons on **fundamental data structures in Python**, focusing on concepts

## 01_Array_Introduction
- Introduction to Arrays  
- Types of Arrays (1D, 2D, 3D, Jagged)  
- Memory management responsibility in C vs Python  


## 02_Array_Operations_Implementation
- Implementation of a function to **resize arrays**  
- Implementation of a function to **access elements by index**  `getAt` 
- Understanding array operations at a low-level (manual implementation)  


## 03_Linked List_Introduction_Singly_list_implementation
- What is a Linked List and how it differs from arrays  
- Types of Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- Infrastructure: nodes stored in **independent, non-consecutive memory locations** connected by pointers  
- Singly Linked List basics with diagrams  
- Implementation of core operations:  
  - **insert_last** → insert new node at the end  
  - **insert_after** → insert new node after a given node  
  - **insert_before** → insert new node before a given node  
  - **delete_node** → delete a specific node
